It took me half an hour to figure out how to send a sourcepath to sublimelinter-javac.
Here it is:

        "linters": {
            "javac": {
                "@disable": false,
                "args": ["-sourcepath", "/Users/YOUR_NAME_HERE/src/udder/udder/src/main/java/"],
                "excludes": [],
                "lint": ""
            },
            "pyflakes": {
                "@disable": false,
                "args": [],
                "excludes": []
            }
        },

It lives under args, as an array of strings.
-cp or -classpath should also be options.

I believe the "lint" setting just parameterizes the -Xlint setting, like -Xlint:path.
