transport notifications - layer % 0 / nonzero transition
(eventually play/stop/fwd/ffwd/step+/step-/tempo? etc)

external LFO registered (in mixer? or totally separate command generator?) 
programmed to turn down everything else and then turn up Woven, at which point
it should receive a transport notification, reset(), and fire up.

how does external LFO know when Woven is all done?
Woven runs in the mixer thread, does this mean that external LFO should run as
a mixer event -- registered as if it were a layer, served animate() before the
rest of it? probably so... Woven could just have an extra ivar for the LFO
notification.
